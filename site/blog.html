            <p>Welp, that's embarrassing.</p>
            <p>So i moved on the weekends. Was very veryyyy dissociated. Nothing felt real. I mean it is pretty usual, but it was much worse. I spent the rest of the day playing minecraft... My roommate glanced over at me a couple of times when she was going to her room. I thought she wasn't happy to see me there... But the next day she came up to me and actually introduced herself. She'd also an artist and she plays genshin.</p>
            <p>Also another girl was supposed to live with me in the room but she left immedeately bcs she "doesn't wanna live with strangers". And i SO understand her. That's one of main reasons i didn't wanna move in here.</p>
            <p>There's no WI-FI here, so i have to use my mobile data. I'm a little conserned about how fast i'm gonna use it up, but my roommate said she can turn on her hotspot if i need to since she's got unlimited data. I need to look into different plans though too...</p>
            <p>Yesterday was very boring in college cuz i dont do anything in 2 of 3 classes we had. I picked up my friend's laptop and had to carry it all the way from college cuz i wanted to go to the store on the way back... Wish i took a taxi tbh. I dropped the bag with groceries and the milk bag popped ToT. And my arms still hurt.</p>
            <p>Today i slept in and missed college... Couldn't care less. I wasn't feeling good yesterday anyway.</p>
            <p>Also i made a song. <a href="https://youtu.be/wWUr4qF_X4Q?si=4KquOBib6Pvdhn5t">heres the link...</a> and this is the <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yn6ypek2">beepbox</a></p>
            <p>Anddd i'm finally working on characters' refs. Yeah.</p>

            <p>Was forced to visit family twice and the year JUST started. Now i'm being forced to move to a different apartment. I hate it. I don't wanna live with someone else. I don't want my guardian to control my life. If I cannot do what i want in my life, then i don't want it at all.</p>
            <p>I knew I was gonna kill myself sooner or later, and was planning on this month... Guess it's time. I'm gonna pack all my stuff... And clean up. And then I'm gonna stream on that day.</p>
            <p>People laugh at my struggles. It's entertaining. Then I'll give them a show.</p>
            <p>Though planning it more makes me second guess it, so I shouldn't do it. Don't overthink it. This day would come either way.</p>
            <p>In a little while, I'll be gone.</p>

            <p>i can never feel at ease when things are good... i know it's not gonna last.</p>
            <p>i'm enjoying playing minecraft and sky a lot. I helped Simon finish building WTC today and also fell from it 4 times...</p>
            <p>also cleaned the apartment. just wiping dust off every surface. it's it ironic how dusty everying gets, knowing i'm allergic? I mean... i know it's probably the depression. But at least once a week i pick up the trash and clothes from the floor of my room!</p>

            <p>a while ago, our teacher gave us a task to write instruction to a lego robot. As in, we were supposed to write out every step in words, based on the picture instructions. i spent multiple hours on it, staying up late.</p>
            <p>then she forgot about it. so a couple of classes lates, i reminded her, and then she asked us to send her those in.</p>
            <p>then a few more classes passed, she didn't mention it. i came up to her, asking about it. she said that work would not be graded.</p>
            <p>i felt berayed. like in first class of math in high school, when the teacher gave us the task to write an essay about how math affects our panebts' jobs, just to say it was a joke the next class.</p>
            <p>i don't need a grade, dammit, i don't make half the graded work (at least in time), i just want at least asknowlage the work that went into it. I have a really hard time focusing on college tasks, cuz i'm not interested in them, and i often feel like i don't understand how to do anythiing, despite my classmates dealing with everything just fine.</p>
            <p>i just want someone to notice when i'm trying.</p>

            <p>Im sitting in the computer science class rn waiting for the teacher to be free to check my project. The sun shines so fucking bright and I'm trying to cover my screen with my shadow to reduce the reflecting lights. My spine is warm. It's very quiet, the classes are ongoing. It's weird, but it feels like spring. This sleepy, lazy atmosphere, like we're about to leave for summer break. And it's warm outside, despite it snowing a few days ago. I am of the opinion that weather here changes more often than my mood. Can weather be BPD-coded? I guess anything can. It's not like it's a real thing anyway, just a label.</p>
            <p>I feel weird when the weather is like this... All i can say is that it feels like spring. I have a dedicated playlist for this feeling. Glass beach's cul-de-sac, neon glow, 1015, bone skull and more, cuckoo song, record player song, pretty much all the he's not with us anymore album by casio dad, kyu-kurarin. Usually i listen to different music.</p>

            <p>honestly, i like jax. not in tumblr sexyman way, but in the way that i like him as character, i like seeing him torturing others. but i like seeing him suffer too, it's funny. and with the new episode, gangle felt very unusual and honestly? creepy. fucking hate those over-positive people/characters. they are at best just annoying, and at worst unsettlng. so when he said "i liked you better when you were sad" i think the same. at that point i wouldn't just having fun athcing him torment angle as per usual, i would support that... </p>
            <p>ANYWAY traumatized jax s????? i love it haha</p>
            <p>i think people who fan over characters like jax and alastor often mischaracterize them by giving them redeeming qualities. by making them "soften" or open up to someone. and what i have to say? that's stupid. no, jax would not have a "emberassing crush" on you/your oc/canon char! jax is a sadist. and i think if anyone like him was put in a one room, they'd start fighting immedeately. maybe i'm projecting?</p>
            <p>anyway it's 2:30 in the morning i should hit the hay</p>
            <p>fuckign wish i wasn't sober rn. i'm gonna need something to keep me alive just for long enough</p>
