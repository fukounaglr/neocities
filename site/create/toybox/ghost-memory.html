            Ghost memory is a small side project of mine i started to practice writing stories.<br>
            It is a small game about trauma, loss, queerness and other.<br>
            Just to be clear, I am on the stage of writing the script [the overall story is pretty much complete] and i'm pretty busy at the moment, so don't expect big updates any time soon.
