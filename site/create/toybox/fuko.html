            <h5>Lore</h5>
            <p>Fuko Una is a sentient AI robot cat living in a artificial world filled with oblivious Npc's, where nothing ever happens. No matter how much the world tries to replicate "real life events", it all feels fake.</p>
            <p>Fuko doesn't know if any of his memories are true. She tried many times to make friends, but no one can understand their worldview. It has tried to "escape", but couldn't due to the programming. Every time they try, they just end up at the same place.</p>
            <p>Out of despair and boredom, it has turned to self endangering behavior that can sometimes end up in serious injuries, knowing that they cannot die. It also started messing around with the world itself, becoming sort of a "hacker", they'd mess around with people or things around them.</p>
            <p>One time, going down the street from school, Fuko found a weird object that looked like a static crack in the fabric of the reality. She tried to touch it, but it made them have some kind of seisure and throw up. Fuko fegured it happened because he's not meant to encounter anomaly like this. Fuko decided to put it in her backback and take it home.</p>
            <p>He kept it in there for a while, sometimes checking on it, not knowing what to do. One day he they noticed that crack is growing way too big, she unzipped the backpack and the static filled her room, consuming everything around. Soon the world was fully consumed by it and there was nothing left.</p>
            <p>Fuko woke up in a computer system. With her previous hacking experience, they quickly reached the internet. She can't talk itself, but it found a way to clip words from internet media. It acts like a virus in a lot of ways. They can use any program on the computer.</p>
