            <p>Gochi is Plush and Red's middle sibling. It's non-verbal and use signs and symbols to communicate (fun fact: it uses "fish" to refer to itself and "star" to refer to Plush). Gochi studying at home due to their anxiety. It has friends in their class, Egg and Aggel,  who often come visit.</p>
            <p>It has a tendency to run away when feeling stressed, trying to find a safe place to hide, so Plush gave it a bracelet with gps tracker, so he could find Gochi and pick it up to get home.</p>
