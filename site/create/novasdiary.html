        <p>We got here a few hours ago. we've been given new clothes, a room and food. I haven't eaten any of it tho... Not feeling like it.<br>
            I feel tired but i don't wanna go to sleep yet. Sebastian hasn't returned yet. I'll just doodle for now.</p>

            <p>I can't sleep any longer. It's only 11 am, and I fell asleep well into the night. I think i'll be fine.</p>
            <p>Last night when i finally went to bed after Seb returned, i cried. I don't know why. There were so many things on my mind. I guess I just haven't had the opportunity to cry for a long time... Even before Urbnshade, i think I as just too focused on surviving. I just dissociated most of the time.</p>
            <p>It's just so nice to have something normal after all this time. I cried while eating my last night's food...</p>
        <p>I think we're gonna be okay.</p>
