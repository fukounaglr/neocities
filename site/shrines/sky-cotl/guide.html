                <p>Hello, fellow Moth! </p>
                <p>If you are new in the world of Sky, you are considered a "moth" - a new player! You might have questions, and I'm here to help you!</p>
                <p>On this page you will find information on different mechanics and other stuff.</p>

                <h5>Wing cape</h5>
                <p>Wing cape is a core part of the game. You can use your cape to fly. You can buy different capes, but you cannot take it off.</p>
                <p>When you start playing, you receive a 1-level cape. You can level up your cape by finding <b>winged light</b> in locations of Sky, as well as by receiving <b>wing buff</b> by helping spirits.</p>
                <p>Stars at the back of your cape display what <b>level</b> your cape is. there are 5 stars, but they can have up to 3 layers.</p>
                <p>Each cape level (or star) gives you 1 wing flap. The more levels of cape you have, the higher you can fly. There are 2 modes of flying: hovering and gliding.</p>

                <h5>Spirits and expressions</h5>
                <p>Going through the realms of Sky, you will find ancestor spirits, that you can help by reliving their memories. In return, spirits will give you an expression. After you help the spirit, you can buy spells, cosmetics from them as well as new expression levels.</p>
                <p><b>Regular spirits</b> are just what they are called. They can be found in each realm, and their cosmetics are available at all times. They are required to complete realms' constellations.</p>
                <p><b>Elder spirits</b> are elders of realms' temples. They appear in temple cutscenes. Their cosmetics are only accessible after completing given realm's constellation.</p>
                <p><b>Seasonal spirits</b> are spirits, which are a part of a season. Most of these spirits can still be found in realms like regular spirits are, but their cosmetics are not available.</p>
                <p><b>Season guides</b> are special seasonal spirits, which have quests that you have to complete.</p>
                <p><b>Travelling spirits</b> are seasonal spirits that become available for a limited time. Usually a random spirit comes once every 2 weeks and stays for 4 days. Sometimes spirits come in small groups based on a theme, and that is called a "Special visit" or "Group visit".</p>

                <h5>In-game currency</h5>
                <p>There are multiple currencies in the Sky: Regular Candles, Regular Hearts, Eden Candles, Event Currency, Seasonal Candles and Seasonal Hearts</p>
                <p><b>Regular Candles</b> is the main currency. You get them from collecting light from candles in realms, time events, races etc... The candle icon has multiplication indicators: at the start of the day, there's 3 of them: after each 5 candles that you forge, one indicator dissapears. So, after 15 candles you have no multiplicators, but you can collect more light. Max amount of candles you can get in a day is 20.</p>
                <p><b>Regular Hearts</b> is the currency you use to buy some emote updrages and cosmetics. You can buy them from spirits, get send them by friends, or get pieces of heart by lighting friend's candle every day.</p>
                <p><b>Eden Candles</b> can be used to buy some buffs from spirits. You can get them from completing the Eye of Eden quest or completing Red Shard quest.</p>
                <p><b>Event Currency</b> is the currency of the "days of X" currency. There are different events, like Days of Nature, Days of Colour, Days of Music etc... Those are events that happen on set periods of time, mostly each year. By particiapating in events each day, you collect set amount of event currency. You can spend event currency on event cosmetics.</p>
                <p><b>Seasonal Candles</b> are seasonal currency. Seasons are temporary events that add new quests, spirits and cosmetics and they do not repeat. You can get them from completing daily quests and collecting light from seasonal candles in the realm of the daily quests.</p>
