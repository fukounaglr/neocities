                <h5>Currency</h5>
                <p>There are multiple currencies in the Sky: Regular Candles, Regular Hearts, Eden Candles, Event Currency, Seasonal Candles and Seasonal Hearts</p>
                <p>Regular Candles is the main currency. You get them from collecting light from candles in realms, time events, races etc... The candle icon has multiplication indicators: at the start of the day, there's 3 of them: after each 5 candles that you forge, one indicator dissapears. So, after 15 candles you have no multiplicators, but you can collect more light. Max amount of candles you can get in a day is 20.</p>
                <p>Regular Hearts is the currency you use to buy some emote updrages and cosmetics. You can buy them from spirits, get send them by friends, or get pieces of heart by lighting friend's candle every day.</p>
                <p>Eden Candles can be used to buy some buffs from spirits. You can get them from completing the Eye of Eden quest or completing Red Shard quest.</p>
                <p>Event Currency is the currency of the "days of X" currency. There are different events, like Days of Nature, Days of Colour, Days of Music etc... Those are events that happen on set days each year.</p>
                <p>Seasonal Candles and Seasonal Hearts are seasonal currency. Seasons are temporary events, that add quests, spirits and cosmetics and they do not repeat. You can get them from completing daily quests and collecting light from seasonal candles in the realm of the daily quests.</p>
