            <p>Sam is  an anxious and socially distant teen. They can be very agressive toward other kids and often get in fights. They avoid adults. They don't have friends and get bullied by other kids and even adults for their behavor. They often ask "weird" questions, like how many times you can cut a worm in half, scaring people by walking silently or staring. </p>
            <p>They have been recorded sleepwalking, punching walls while asleep, hovering over other people at night staring, trying to choke their classmate outside of school.</p>
            <p>One night they <mark>[redacted]</mark> their  <mark>[redacted]</mark> being half consious. When they came back to their senses, it took them some time to realize what they've done. Not knowing what to do, they decided that the only thing they could do was <mark>[redacted]</mark>.</p>
